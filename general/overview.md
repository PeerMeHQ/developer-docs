# 👁 Overview

Politicians screw us. Banks invalidate our money. Schools teach us to follow existing rules and to be followers of those in power.
The systems in our society are **fundamentally broken** — and we are here to change that using software and philosophy.

> Superciety is a decentralized autonomous organization (a DAO) built on top of the Elrond blockchain.

Anyone can contribute – our code is [open-source](https://github.com/superciety) – and earn Superciety's governance token **\$SUPER** as a financial incentive which also comes with future utilities.

Technology has radically changed the way we live - beyond what anyone could imagine. We have proven to create systems that are greater than ourselves, systems that serve us and let even the poorest of a developed society live better than the kings and Pharaohs of the past.

We have entered the End-Stage of life we know today. The race to Superciety has long begun, and we are still not done accelerating.

Welcome to the next generation of societies — Society 2.0, Superciety.
