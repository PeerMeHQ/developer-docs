# 🧽 Clean Code

> “Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.” - Martin Golding

These are some guideliness for keeping the code nice and tidy.

- Only write (and commit) code that is used and necessary.
- Write expressive variable, function and class names.
- Avoid unnecessary type annotations that can be deducted by type inference.
- Sort imports and use statements
- Only leave commented code if necessary and a description why it was commented
